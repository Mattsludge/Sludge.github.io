        Oh shit that reminds me actually on the topic of music okay so idk if everyone knows so ill put it here but ive got a bit of a vendetta against weezer basically. i refuse to listen to weezer. ive never willingly turned it on of my own accord, and for the forseeable future i never will. its probably pretty good, but for now i refuse to even look at those guys. heres the thing. i *will* listen to weezer at some point, but only under the context of like.. having sex. okay listen. dont leave yet. listen. weezer is the like defacto virgin music right? so how funny would it be to only listen to that shit during the opposite of it. this is my genius plan</td>

        dude okay listen to me. listen to the words im saying. i just wanna say this here cause its the most annoying thing fucking ever. i fucking HAAAAATE music fans. and not like dudes who are just enthusiastic about their favorite band or whatever i mean the annoying assholes who treat every album like a fuckin animal that needs to be dissected. like the guys who make those annoying ass topsters and treat them with the importance of their godman firstborn. like, thats cool. good for you. and none of this would be an even remote issue if these losers just talked about music normally. like i bring up oingo boingo or ween or some shit and these fucking actual real life no life losers have it in their brains that music like big fat fuck is something that needs to be gatekept. like talking about music just become the most miserbale arduous task ever even conceivable. like for whatever reason these dudes cannot be normal about music at all. and maybe im the annoying one here, right? maybe this is just one of those internet cesspools that i just wasnt meant to ever interact with cause im a loser contrarian nerd but i dont give a fuck! you guys are so annoying and i hate you forever</td>
