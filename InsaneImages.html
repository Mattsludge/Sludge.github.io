            yo waddup It ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars Hey, I know it's just a song, but it's spice for the recipe This is a love attack, I know it went out, but it's back It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact And just like fashion it's a passion for the with-it and hip If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it Just to stay in the clique So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out Allow if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive And if you follow there may be a tomorrow But if the offer's shunned You might as well be walking on the Sun Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out Of recession and oppression and together they toked And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened? Then some were spellbound, some were hellbound Some, they fell down and some got back up And fought back against the meltdown And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out Allow if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow But if the offer's shunned You might as well be walking on the sun It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up Mr. Wizard can't perform no god-like hocus-pocus So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack Put away the crack before the crack puts you away You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out Allow if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow But if the offer's shunned You might as well be walking on the sun You might as well be walking on the sun You might as well be walking on the sun You might as well be walking on the sun You might as well be walking on the sun
